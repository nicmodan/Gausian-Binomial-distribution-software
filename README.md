## Binomial & Gaussian Distribution Software

#### Required Python libraries 
    Matplotlib

#### General Distribution file
> This is the main distribution file that has the main methods and 
attributes that is distributed to create a binomial distribution
and a gaussian distribution   

**read_data_file**

>Function to read in data from a txt file. The txt file should have
one number (float) per line. The numbers are stored in the data attribute 
>
> This method only takes in file that contain a Binomial numbering `0,1` 

#### Binomial Distribution_challenge file
Binomial distribution class for calculating and 
    visualizing a Binomial distribution
 Binomial distribution class for calculating and 
    visualizing a Binomial distribution.
    
Attributes:
- mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
- stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
- data_list (list of floats) a list of floats to be extracted from the data file
- p (float) epresenting the probability of an event occurring


#### Gaussian Distribution file 
Generic distribution class for calculating and visualizing a probability distribution.
	
Attributes:

- mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
- stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
- data_list (list of floats) a list of floats extracted from the data file
